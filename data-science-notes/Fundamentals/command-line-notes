## Things leaned about Command Line
    # Command Line Details
        ~ == means home directory
        absolute path == where you are according to the root of the file system
            - Full address or the lat/longitude is a good IRL example
            - /Users/your_username/Downloads is an example of a absolute path to a file
        Relative path == will change depending on your location b/c your locatiuon will end up chaninging as you move around
            - That gastation is 2 blocks to the left is a good IRL example
        Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way to directly issue commands to your OS.
            - there are hundreds/thousands of CL commands
        We need to be able to orient ourselves on the command line. 
        You may be connecting to servers only through the command line...
    #Window based operating system:
        WYSIWYG
        What You See Is What You Get
        - you see all the options
        - all the menu options live in the menu
        Unfortunately, w/ a WSYWYG interface, 
        what you see is ALL you get.

    # copy (cp) works like move (mv)
        cp target destination
        cp target.txt copy.txt

        cp file.txt file2.txt 
    # Flags
        -a == all files
        -l == long format
        -h == hujan readable output

    # Relative Path vs. Absolute Path
        Relative path example: the gas station is two blocks to the left.
        Absolute Path: the full address or lat/long of that exact gas station
        pwd returns the full, absolute path to where you are currently
