# About Me

  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

👽 Greetings! My name is Caitlyn Carney, and I am currently a student at Codeup in their data-science program. I previously worked for Marriott International as a "Data Specialist". From there I returned to school and recieved an associates in science before coming to codeup. So you can come to a reasonable hypothesis that data is my life! 

I am really enjoying learning everything I can in data science! However, I am definitely drawn to the visual side of it! I find myself playing in seaborn, matplotlib, and starting to play in Tableau alot! I also really enjoy makig presentations to really catch and keep the audiences attention! My other favorite thing I have so far learned is cleaning data, I don't know what it is but it is very theraputic to sit down and make data easy to read and understand 💆‍♀️.

On my free time I enjoy relaxing with a nice book, playing some games on my pc, and playing with my dogs (my husky puppy, April, is so sweet! 🐺 ❤️).
