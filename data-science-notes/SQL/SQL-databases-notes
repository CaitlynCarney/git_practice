Where tables live
    - rows live in tables
    - columns live in tables

SHOW DATABASES; = kind of like "ls" for all DATABASES 
    . must have semicolon(;) at the end

you can;t be in multiple databases at once

USE(database_name); = sets "current working database" to specified database.
    . think of thos as cd

SELECT DATABASE(); = shows you currently selected database

SHOW CREATE DATABASE(database_name); = shows the code that created the specified database.

"Database" & "schema" mean the same thing and can be used interchangibly

words like select, insert, create are resered words in MySQL and cant be used for a 
    . databse
    . table 
    . column names
