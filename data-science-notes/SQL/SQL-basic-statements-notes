How to look at data in databases

CRUD operations
    - create, read, update, and delete

single quotes (') are the SQL standard

if you need to actually use a single guote (') for a string, use either (\') or ('')
    - \ means forget it

SELECT
    - limits columns to find and return rows from a table
        . USE fruits_db;
        SELECT name, quantity
        FROM fruits;

*
    - means all the columns

WHERE
    - filters our data for us
        . limits rows
    - allows you to specify conditions tha tmust be true for a given row to be displayed
        SELECT *
        FROM fruits
        WHERE name = 'dragon fruit

        SELECT *
        FROM fruits
        WHERE id = 5

= : Equal
!= or <> :  Not Equal
< : less than
> : greater than
<= : less than or equal too
>= : greater than or equal too
BETWEEN value1 AND value2 : greathe than or equal to value1 and less than of equal to value2

ex:
    2 = 2;
    1 = 2;
    1 < 2;
    2 <= 3;
    BETWEEN 1 AND 3;
    2 != 2;
    1 > 2;

Remember if it returns 0 it means false and if it returns 1 it means true

Aliases (AS) allow us to temporarily rename a column, table, or mesc piece of our query

AS
    - command for Aliases 
        SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', lasy_name) as full_name
        from employees

you can work SQL skripts on command line
    MySQL - u USERNMAE -p -h DB_HOST -t < filename.SQL

-u = USERNMAE
-p = password
-h = host #

% = wild card and can take 0 or more characters

Sometimes when looking at SQL a column can caontain a string. However, what if you need to see 
anything rom said column that mention something specific such as the genre "Rock"

    SELECT *
    FROM albums
    WHERE genre LIKE 'Rock%'
        
        this foramt will show you all songs with a genre which the string contais the "Rock" genre

    SELECT *
    FROM albums
    WHERE genre LIKE '%Rock%'

        this will show you all genres with rock in it such as Hard Rock, Alternative Rock, etc.
