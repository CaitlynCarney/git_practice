only make changes in your temprary tables not in your primary tables

create temp table:
    - create temporary table table_name(...)

create forever table:
    - create table table_name(...)
        . you're just dropping the temporary

Temporary Tables do go away

allows us to take a query and create a table

almost like a variable

can only make temp tables in a dab=tabase where you have permission too do so.

        create tempary table numbers as(
            select 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 * 12))
        select *
        from numbers;

            - will not show up under tables on left but will be shown below.
              * left is for permanent tables only *

can create one from a query

-----------------------------------------Updating Tables-------------------------------------------

update to modify the info in our table

        update my_numbers
        set n = n + 1;
        select *
        from my_numbers


        update my_numbers
        set n = 500
        where n = 3
        select* from my_numbers
            
            - using numbers where to isolate specific numbers

---------------------------------------Delete From Tables-------------------------------------------

delete from to remove some records

        delete from my_numbers
        where n = 3

            - removes 3rd row

        delete from my_numbers

            - deletes all records

when working with temp tables:
    - start by using your own database

        create tamporary table emp_salary as(
            use easley_1268
            select *
            from employees.employees #db_name.table_name
            join employees.salaries using(emp_no)
            where to_date > curdate());
        select *
        emp_salary;

            - makes temp table of current employees with their emp_salary

3 steps to success:
    1. use your own database
            use easley_1268;
    2. write the query you need to use, using the db_name.table_nmae after your FROM or your join
            select *
            from employees.employeesjoin employees.salaries using (emp_no)
            where to_date > curdate()
    3. wrap your above query in CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table_na,e as();
            create temporary table emp_salary as(
                select *
                from employees.employees
                join employees.salaries using(emp_no)
                where to_date > curdate());
            select *
            from emp_salary;

After we have a temp table we can get to work:
    - Querying from it
    - Altering data

What would our total salary be if everyone gets a 5% raise?
         update emp_salary
         set salary = salary + salary * 0.05;
         select *
         from emp_salary;
         select *
         from emp_salary
         where first_name = "Mary"
         and salary > 60,000
