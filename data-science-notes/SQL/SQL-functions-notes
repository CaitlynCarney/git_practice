Transforms data

COUNT
    - gives number of rows a query results in

CONCAT
    - adds strings together

        SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
        FROM employees
        LIMIT 10;
            - results in first and last name combined and shows the first 10 results

SUBSTR
    - extracts part of a string

        SELECT SUBSTR(upper("hello"), 4, 2);
            - where the 4 is indicates where to start
            - where the 2 is indicated how many characters long

REPLACE
    - manipulates a string by replacing

        SELECT REPLACE(title, "Senior", "Lead")
        FROM title

NOW
    - returns the current date and time
        . YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

        SELECT NOW();

CURDATE
    - returns date 
        . YYYY-MM-DD

        SELECT CURDATE();

CURTIME
    - returns time 
        . HH:DD:MM

        SELECT CURTIME();

UNI_TIME
    - used to represent time as an integer


SELECT *
FROM salaries
WHERE to_date > CURDATE()

AVG
    - shows the mean

        SELECT AVG(salary)
        FROM salaries
        WHERE to_date > CURDATE();

MIN
    - shows the minimum

        SELECT MIN(salary) as minimum_current_salary
        FROM salaries
        WHERE to_date > CURDATE();

        SELECT MIN(emp_no)
        FROM employees;

Casting lets us convert one type into another

CAST
    - turns something into another

        SELECT
            CAST(123 as char)
            CAST('123' as unsigned); 

        SELECT
            CAST ("-123" as signed);
                . casting a string with a negative number to an integer

        SELECT  
            CAST(78210 as char);
                . casting a number to a string
