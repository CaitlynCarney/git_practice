SubQueries:
    - A query within a query

        select *
        from table_a
        where column_a in(
            select column_a
            from table_b)

        - think of russian nesting dolls

Joins allow us to stitch together tables based on keys

        select *
        from employees
        where emp_no in( 
            select emp_no
            from dept_manager
            where to_date > curdate())
        and gender = "F";

                . where the emp_no's are located they MUST be the same
                    - cant be emp_no and dept_no
                    - can't be emp_no and first_name
                    - can ONLY be emp_no and emp_no

subqueires using IN are pretty darn fast

        select first_name, last_name, birth_date
        from employeeswhere emp_no in(
            select emp_no
            from dept_manager)
        limit 10

            - You dont always have to use "in within a subquerie!
                . you can use "NOT IN" too
